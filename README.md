# Spring Security Basic Example 🚀
This is a basic Spring Security project built for My learning purposes.
## ⚠️ Note:
This is not a production-ready application. It’s just for practicing Spring Security concepts, so it may contain errors or incomplete features.

It demonstrates:
- Setting up Spring Security with @EnableWebSecurity
- Using BCryptPasswordEncoder for secure password storage
- Implementing a custom UserDetailsService
- Configuring an AuthenticationProvider (DaoAuthenticationProvider)
- Stateless session management (useful for APIs)
A simple UserService to encode and save users

## Tech Stack 🛠
- Java 17+ (or your installed version)
- Spring Boot (Security, Web, Data JPA)
- H2/MySQL (depending on your setup)
- Maven

## Learning Goals 🎯

- Understand how Spring Security authentication works
- Learn to use PasswordEncoder for hashing
- Explore the role of SecurityFilterChain and AuthenticationProvider
- Practice building secure APIs

## Next Steps 🔜

- Add JWT authentication
- Create role-based authorization
- Add login & signup REST APIs
- Integrate with a frontend (e.g., React/Flutter)
